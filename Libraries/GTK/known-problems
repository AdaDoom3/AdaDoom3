- L924-024 GtkAda.Canvas default layout incorrect with self links
  Problem:    When an item's first out link is a link to itself, this
              item will not get a proper location through the default
              automatic layout algorithm.
  Workaround: Either make sure the self-link is not first, or specify
              explicit coordinates for the item in the call to Put

- KC01-003 Changing the theme on-the-fly may cause a SIGSEGV
  Problem:    When using buttons and comboboxes, changing the theme
              may cause a SIGSEGV if both properties gtk-button-images
              and GtkComboBox::appears-as-list are modified.
  Workaround: Do not change your theme on-the-fly, but only upon restart.

  Problem:    Under Windows, when displaying text in a Gtk_Plot_Canvas,

              and double quotes.
  Workaround: No known workaround.

- JC10-011 Gtkada.MDI gives focus when raising a window
  Problem:    When selecting a floating window via the /Window
              menu, there were a number of cases where the window was
              not properly raised (depending on your window manager and
              system). The MDI will now additionally give the text focus
              to that window.
  Workaround: Call Raise_Child manually to make sure the window was raised

- JC09-041 Gtk.Widget.Get_Snapshot fails and causes crashes
  Problem:    Calling Gtk.Widget.Get_Snapshot causes memory corruption and
              potentially crashes.
  Workaround: Fix the binding to Get_Snapshot: parameter Clip_Rect should be
              a Gdk.Rectangle.Gdk_Rectangle_Access rather than 
              a Gtk.Rectangle.Gdk_Rectangle.
